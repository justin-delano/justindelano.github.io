I'm Justin, a current Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics Ph.D. student living in Boston, MA. I originally started my academic career as a Math major at Northeastern University, but exposure to computational biology research in the <a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/radivojac/">Radivojac Lab</a> inspired me to push my math and data science skills in a new direction. I further exposed myself to bioinformatics through my Applied Math master's degree program, and research at Massachusetts General Hospital under the direction of <a href="https://i3.mgh.harvard.edu/faculty/dubach-matt/">Dr. Matt Dubach</a>.

Now that I'm working on a Ph.D., I'm interested in creating tools for the functional genomics community to use when searching for interesting genetic mechanisms. My work with <a href="https://main.pinellolab.partners.org/">Dr. Luca Pinello</a> has focused on analyzing CRISPR genome editing data to better understand genetic and epigenetic variation.
